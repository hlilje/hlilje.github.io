    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      Since I study full-time during the semesters, I try to work during the entire summer holidays
      to gain work experince, develop my skills and expand my professional network.
      <br><br>
      This summer was spent at Fortum where I created an Excel tool for downloading, interpreting,
      managing and uploading ingurgent energy market information. I also created an Excel test suite
      for a database plugin.
      <br><br>
      The previous summer I worked at Ericsson, where I developed an internal website for product
      substitution.
