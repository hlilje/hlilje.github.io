    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>
      I love software development, which is the reason for my computer science studies
      and my future career path. Most of the major school projects I have been involved,
      or created myself, is available on <a href="https://github.com/hlilje">GitHub</a>.
      <br><br>
      Some examples include building a <a href="https://github.com/hlilje/komp14-compiler">MiniJava compiler</a> to Jasmin assembly code,
      building a <a href="https://github.com/hlilje/dgi14-voxels">procedural landscape voxel renderer</a> using Perlin noise,
      and developing <a href="https://github.com/mvk13ogb/qwait">QWait</a>, the next generation lab queueing system for KTH CSC.
      <br><br>
      More complete project information is available on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/hampus-liljekvist/46/72/902">LinkedIn</a>
      or my <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~hlilje/">KTH website</a>.

    <h3>Game Development</h3>
    <p>
      I have created a couple of games in Java, but my <a href="https://github.com/hlilje/sfml-game">current game project</a>
      is made in C++ using the SFML library.
      This project is on hold while I spend more of my spare time on music production.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>
      Most of my web development has been done in school or at work, but personally I have this website to maintain.
      I have also started a (Go) <a href="http://hlilje-app.appspot.com/">Google App Engine application</a>
      which I might turn into something wonderful, after I have thought of a good webapp to create.
