## Music

Music has always been a part of my life, and since 2008 I have had a
personal music project on an on-and-off basis.  I took a break from
creating music in order to focus more on my programming skills, but
now I have gotten back into music production again.

I tend to produce semi-experimental electronic music spanning different
genres. My DAW of choice is [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/),
an excellent tracker, though frustrating by nature. In addition to this
I use various plugins and samples.  I have also had my way with Cubase
and Ableton Live, though I now only use Renoise.

You will find my complete discography at [Bandcamp](https://hlilje.bandcamp.com/),
while you can find some songs and more random clips at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/hlilje).

### Backtracker

My latest full album release is [Backtracker](https://hlilje.bandcamp.com/album/backtracker),
which I wrote a short [blog post](http://hlilje.tumblr.com/post/91966633633/backtracker-album-reflection-comment)
about.
