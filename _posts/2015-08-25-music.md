## {{ page.title }}

Music has always been an integral part of my life, electronic music in particular.
I have since 2008 had a music project on an on-and-off basis, which I currently
spend little time with as I primarily focus on my software development skills.

I use [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/) for producing unstructured and somewhat
ambiguous electronic music spanning different genres. You will find my complete
discography at [Bandcamp](http://music.{{ site.url_short }}), and you can find
songs, samples and ideas over at [SoundCloud]({{ site.data.links['Music Production']['SoundCloud'] }}).

One of my dreams is to learn how to play piano.

### Currently

In January 2016 I released the five-track EP [Pessimist]({{ site.data.links['Music Production']['SoundCloud'] }}/sets/pessimist),
which consists of four tracks I made after I decided to completely stop using
tweaked presets and start using proper scales. The fifth track is a cover of
Todd Terje's "Inspector Norse".

### Listening

[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) has allowed me to discover vast amounts of
new music and it is essentially the sole way I consume music. Check out my
[Spotify profile]({{ site.data.links['Music']['Spotify'] }}) for some sweet
playlists!

I have been scrobbling since 2007, so you can find listening data galore over
at my [Last.fm profile]({{ site.data.links['Music']['Last.fm Profile'] }}).
