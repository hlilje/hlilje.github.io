## Music

Music has always been an integral part of my life, in particular, electronic
music. I have since 2008 had a music project on an on-and-off basis, which I
recently started taking seriously. I took a break from creating music in order
to focus more on developing my programming skills, but now my focus has shifted
to learning music production for real. In order to do so I study some basic
music theory and play some piano, and I have taken to heart
[Orbital](http://orbitalofficial.com/)'s advice of not using synth presets.

I tend to produce unstructured electronic music spanning different genres. My
current DAW is [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/), an excellent tracker, though
frustrating by nature. I would switch to Ableton Live in a heartbeat if it
was not so very expensive. In addition to Renoise I use various plugins and
samples. I have also had my way with Cubase, which is the music software I used
in the beginning.

You will find my complete discography at
[Bandcamp](https://hlilje.bandcamp.com/), while you can find songs and more
random clips at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/hlilje). I like SoundCloud
for its social features, but unfortunately it has silly restrictions on
uploads. Bandcamp is a better place to just host or sell your entire catalogue.

### Currently

My latest full album release is
[Backtracker](https://hlilje.bandcamp.com/album/backtracker),
which I wrote a short
[blog post](http://blog.{{ site.url_short }}/post/91966633633/backtracker-album-reflection-comment)
about. In January 2016 I released the five-track EP
[Pessimist](https://hlilje.bandcamp.com/album/pessimist), which consists of
four tracks I made after I decided to completely stop using tweaked presets and
start using proper scales. The fifth track is a cover of Todd Terje's
"Inspector Norse".

### Other Music

[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) has allowed me to discover vast amounts of
new music (especially now with Discover Weekly), and it is the sole way I
currently consume music. Check out my
[Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/vaexelverkan) for some sweet
playlists! I usually create batch playlists with albums of a certain genre or
style, but recently I decided to start making more handcrafted playlists like
[The Origins of EBM](https://open.spotify.com/user/vaexelverkan/playlist/7oyKh2H94VlX9Vz4IyB9GE).

I have been scrobbling since 2007, so you can find listening data galore over
at my [Last.fm profile](http://www.last.fm/user/LordHali).
