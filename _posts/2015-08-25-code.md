## Code

What intrigues with software development is the possibility to solve complex
problems and build large systems through abstraction. I find great enjoyment
in creating software for people to use and experience, while I get to work
with logical systems to understand the services I use myself on a daily basis.
My interest in programming has evolved from my love for computers and
technology, and it is the reason for my Computer Science studies and my career
path.

Most of the major school projects I have been involved in, or created
myself, are available on
[GitHub]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}). Some
examples include building a
[MiniJava compiler]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/komp14-compiler)
to Jasmin assembly code, building a
[procedural landscape voxel renderer]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/dgi14-voxels)
using Perlin noise, developing [QWait](https://github.com/mvk13ogb/qwait), the
next generation lab queueing system for KTH CSC, building a
[program]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/songmood)
for classifying song lyrics using sentiment analysis, doing a statistical MCMC
[simulation]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/mcmc-train),
and writing a Linux
[shell]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/simple-shell)
in C.

Additional project information is available on
[LinkedIn]({{ site.data.links['Social']['LinkedIn'] }}) or my
[KTH website]({{ site.data.links['Education']['KTH Homepage'] }}).

### Game Development

I aim for a career in video game development, and I have created a couple of
simplistic games like
[Another Game]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/another-game)
in Java with Slick2D. My current
[game project]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/sfml-game)
is made in C++ using the SFML library. I also have some other game design
concepts I would like to explore further when I have the time for it.

My latest spare time game is a variant of Snake written in Lua using the LÃ–VE
library. It is called Lua Love Snake, and you can check it out at its
[GitHub page]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/lua-love-snake).
I have also made a simple text-based
[adventure game]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/text-adventure)
in C++ at KTH.

### Web Development

I have been involved in a fair amount of web development, mostly at work, but
also in school. Personally I have
[this website]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}/hlilje.github.io)
to maintain, and I have also started a Go Google App Engine
[application](http://app.{{ site.url_short }}) which I will probably scrap.
Apart from helping to build [QWait](http://qwait.csc.kth.se/) with Java/Spring,
and JavaScript/AngularJS, I developed a website for product substitution at
Ericsson using VB.NET and Microsoft SQL Server.

This summer has been spent as a web developer at 5 Monkeys creating a website
for a major chain of building suppliers, using exclusively open source
technologies like Python, Django and PostgreSQL.
