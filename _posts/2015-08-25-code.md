## Code

What intrigues with software development is the possibility to solve complex
problems and build large systems through abstraction. I find great enjoyment
in creating software for people to use and experience, while I get to work
with logical systems to understand the services I use myself on a daily basis.
My interest in programming has evolved from my love for computers and
technology, and it is the reason for my Computer Science studies and my career
path.

Most of the major school projects I have been involved in, or created
myself, are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hlilje). Some examples
include building a
[MiniJava compiler](https://github.com/hlilje/komp14-compiler)
to Jasmin assembly code, building a
[procedural landscape voxel renderer](https://github.com/hlilje/dgi14-voxels)
using Perlin noise, developing [QWait](https://github.com/mvk13ogb/qwait), the
next generation lab queueing system for KTH CSC, and building a
[program](https://github.com/hlilje/songmood) for classifying song lyrics using
sentiment analysis.

Additional project information is available on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/hampus-liljekvist/46/72/902) or my
[KTH website](http://www.csc.kth.se/~hlilje/).

### Game Development

I aim for a career in video game development, and I have created a couple of
simplistic games like [Another Game](https://github.com/hlilje/another-game) in
Java with Slick2D. My current
[game project](https://github.com/hlilje/sfml-game) is made in C++ using the
SFML library. This project is on hold while I spend more of my spare time with
music production, but I have some game design concepts I would like to explore
further when I have the time for it.

My latest creation is a version of Snake written in Lua using the LÃ–VE library.
It is called Lua Love Snake, and you can check it out at its
[GitHub page](https://github.com/hlilje/lua-love-snake).

### Web Development

I have been involved in a fair amount of web development, mostly at work, but
also in school. Personally I have
[this website](https://github.com/hlilje/hlilje.github.io) to maintain, and I
have also started a Go Google App Engine
[application](http://app.{{ site.url }}) which I might turn into something
wonderful one day. Apart from helping to build
[QWait](http://qwait.csc.kth.se/) with Java/Spring, and JavaScript/AngularJS,
I developed a website for product substitution at Ericsson using VB.NET and
Microsoft SQL Server.

This summer has been spent as a web developer at 5 Monkeys creating a website
for a major chain of building suppliers, using exclusively open source
technologies like Python, Django and PostgreSQL.
