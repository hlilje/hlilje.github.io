## Code

I love software development, which is the reason for my computer science
studies and my future career path. Most of the major school projects I
have been involved, or created myself, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hlilje).

Some examples include building a [MiniJava compiler](https://github.com/hlilje/komp14-compiler)
to Jasmin assembly code, building a [procedural landscape voxel renderer](https://github.com/hlilje/dgi14-voxels)
using Perlin noise, developing [QWait](https://github.com/mvk13ogb/qwait),
the next generation lab queueing system for KTH CSC,
and building a [program](https://github.com/hlilje/songmood)
for classifying song lyrics using sentiment analysis.

More complete project information is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/hampus-liljekvist/46/72/902)
or my [KTH website](http://www.csc.kth.se/~hlilje/).

### Game Development

I have created a couple of games in Java, but my [current game project](https://github.com/hlilje/sfml-game)
is made in C++ using the SFML library.
This project is on hold while I spend more of my spare time on music
production.

### Web Development

Most of my web development has been done in school or at work, but
personally I have this website to maintain.  I have also started a (Go)
[Google App Engine application](http://hlilje-app.appspot.com/)
which I might turn into something wonderful, after I have thought of a
good webapp to create.
