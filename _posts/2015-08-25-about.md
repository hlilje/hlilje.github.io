My name is Hampus Liljekvist (hlilje). I'm a 23 year old computer
science and engineering student living in Stockholm, Sweden, and
this is my official website.

I enjoy many things in life, like [software development](https://github.com/hlilje),
[gaming](http://steamcommunity.com/id/hlilje),
game development,
[computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine),
[technology](http://arstechnica.com/),

[writing](http://blog.{{ site.url }}),
[art](http://www.simonstalenhag.se/) and what not.

I’m currently doing my fifth and hopefully final year at the Royal
Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden, studying MSE
Computer Science and Engineering (Master's in Theoretical Computer
Science).

At the moment I’m fully focusing on these studies and my programming
skills, but I also spend time producing music.
Gaming and video games have always been my largest areas of interest.

This website works as a hub to my presence on the interwebs, since there
are too many good sites today to justify hosting anything here.
You'll find the links to your right.
Also make sure to check out the other pages on this site for a more
in-depth presentation of my current projects.

Good luck and have fun.
