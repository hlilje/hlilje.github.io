title: about
---

My name is Hampus Liljekvist, and I love learning, self-development and
creation. I am a 23 year old Computer Science and Engineering student living in
Stockholm, Sweden.

I have three major passions in life,
[software development]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}),
[music]({{ site.data.links['Music']['Spotify'] }})
([production]({{ site.data.links['Music Production']['SoundCloud'] }})) and
[video games]({{ site.data.links['Games']['Steam'] }}).
I fancy the combination of mathematical logic and creativity in hands-on
programming, particularly when it involves developing software for people to
experience. Solving complex problems and seeing the result manifest itself in a
better product is something I adore.

Apart from music I highly regard art in general, though I am especially fond
of [film]({{ site.data.links['Video & Film']['IMDb'] }}),
[literature]({{ site.data.links['Writing & Literature']['Goodreads'] }}),
[writing](http://blog.{{ site.url_short }}),
artwork and [design]({{ site.data.links['Graphics & Design']['Flickr'] }}).
One of my newer interests is esports like
[StarCraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/) and
[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/).
I strongly believe in science, contemplation, minimalism and the importance of
a moderated healthy lifestyle. If it is not already apparent, technology plays
a major part in my life.

I am currently doing my fifth year at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm, Sweden, studying MSE Computer Science and Engineering towards a
Master's degree in Theoretical Computer Science. At the moment I am fully
focusing on these studies, but what little spare time I can gather is spent on
developing my music production and programming skills. On the less productive
side I have always had games as my largest area of interest together with
music.

This website works as a hub to my online presence, since there are too many
good websites to justify hosting anything here. You will find links to the web
services I use to your right or below, depending on the device you are viewing
this on. Also make sure to check out the other pages on this site for a more
in-depth presentation of my current projects.

Good luck and have fun.
