My name is Hampus Liljekvist, and I love learning, problem solving and the act of
creation. I am a 24 year old software developer living in Stockholm, Sweden.

I have three major passions in life, [software development]({{ site.data.links['Software Development']['GitHub'] }}),
[music]({{ site.data.links['Music Production']['SoundCloud'] }}) and [video games]({{ site.data.links['Games']['Steam'] }}).
I fancy the combination of mathematical logic and creativity in hands-on programming,
particularly when it involves developing software for people to experience. Solving
complex problems and seeing the result manifest itself in a better product is something
I adore.

Apart from music and video games I highly regard art in general, though I am especially
fond of [film]({{ site.data.links['Video and Film']['IMDb'] }}),
[literature]({{ site.data.links['Writing and Literature']['Goodreads'] }}), [writing](http://blog.{{ site.url_short }}),
and [design]({{ site.data.links['Graphics and Design']['Flickr'] }}). I also enjoy
esports like [StarCraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/) and
[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/).
I try to live a moderated and healthy lifestyle, and if it is not already apparent,
technology plays a major part in my life.

I have studied five years of MSE Computer Science and Engineering at KTH Royal
Institute of Technology towards a Master's degree in Theoretical Computer Science.
At the moment I am fully focusing on my work, but what little spare time I can gather
is spent on developing my programming and music production skills. On the less productive
side I have always had video games and music as my largest areas of interest.

This website works as a hub to my online presence. You will find links to some of the
web services I use to your right or below, depending on the device you are viewing
this on. Also make sure to check out the other pages on this site for a more
in-depth presentation of my current projects.

Good luck and have fun.
