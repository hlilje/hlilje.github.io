## Work

During the semesters I devote 100% of my time to my studies, but I consider the
understanding of practical work extremely important. Therefore I try to work
during the entire summer holidays to gain work experince, develop my skills and
expand my professional network. Doing so has given me a greater understanding
for how the proficiencies I gain from KTH can be applied to real-world
problems, and it has been a catalyst for my focus to build a strong theoretical
foundation through education.

After I graduate from KTH I aim to pursue a career in video game development.
Gaming has always been the largest interest of mine, and I will combine my love
for games and programming by building great games for people to experience.

### Practical Experience

This summer was spent working as a web developer at
[5 Monkeys](http://5monkeys.se/), where I helped develop a website for a major
chain of building suppliers. I worked with features, fixes and integration of
a new product segment. The work climate was relaxed but focused, and we valued
dynamic development with close customer collaboration. This

describes some takeaway points from my time at 5 Monkeys.

The previous summer I worked at
[Fortum](http://www.fortum.com/countries/se/pages/default.aspx) where I created
an Excel tool for downloading, interpreting, managing and uploading urgent
energy market information. I also created an Excel test suite for a database
plugin. We used agile methodologies with daily meetings and goals to make sure
the work was going in the right direction. See this
[blog post](http://blog.{{ site.url_short }}/post/95636942628/fortum-summer-work-reflection)
for a reflection on my Fortum experience.

The summer before that I worked at [Ericsson](http://www.ericsson.com/se),
where I developed an internal website for product substitution. I was the sole
developer on the project, which demanded responsability and dialogue to secure
its success.

### Master Thesis

I am currently doing my Master thesis project at
[Paradox Development Studio](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/paradox-development-studio),
which I am naturally super excited about.
