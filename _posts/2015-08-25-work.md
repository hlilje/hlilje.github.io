## Work

Since I study full-time during the semesters, I try to work during the
entire summer holidays to gain work experince, develop my skills and
expand my professional network.

I will be working at [5 Monkeys](http://5monkeys.se/) this
summer.

The previous summer was spent at Fortum where I created an Excel tool for
downloading, interpreting, managing and uploading urgent energy market
information. I also created an Excel test suite for a database plugin.

The summer before that I worked at Ericsson, where I developed an
internal website for product substitution.
