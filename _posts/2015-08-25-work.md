I have since August 2016 worked as a programmer at [Paradox Development Studio](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/).
Video games has always been one of my largest interests, and being able to combine
this passion with my love for software development is awesome.

In the past I have devoted my entire summer holidays at KTH to working, in order
to gain experince, develop my skills and expand my professional network. Doing so
has given me a greater understanding for how the proficiencies I gain from KTH can
be applied to real-world problems, and it has been a catalyst for my focus to build
a strong theoretical foundation through education.

### Practical Experience

The summer of 2015 was spent working as a web developer at [5 Monkeys](http://5monkeys.se/),
where I continued the development of a website for a major chain of building
suppliers. I worked with features, fixes and integration of a new product segment. The
work climate was relaxed but focused, and we valued dynamic development with close customer
collaboration. This [blog post](http://blog.{{ site.url_short }}/post/129018328988/some-takeaway-points-from-my-summer-job-at-5)
describes some takeaway points from my time at 5 Monkeys.

In the summer of 2014 I worked at [Fortum](http://www.fortum.com/) where I created an
Excel tool for downloading, interpreting, managing and uploading urgent energy market
information. I also created an Excel test suite for a database plugin. We used agile
methodologies with daily meetings and goals to make sure the work was going in the
right direction. See this [blog post](http://blog.{{ site.url_short }}/post/95636942628/fortum-summer-work-reflection)
for a reflection on my Fortum experience.

During the summer holiday of 2013 I worked at [Ericsson](http://www.ericsson.com/),
where I updated end enhanced an internal website for product substitution. I was the sole
developer on the project, which demanded responsability and feedback to secure its success.

### Master Thesis

I did my Master thesis at [Paradox Development Studio](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/),
where I looked at detection of synchronisation problems in networked lockstep games.
