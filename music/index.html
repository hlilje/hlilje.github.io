    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
      Music has always been a part of my life, and since 2008 I have had a personal music project on an on-and-off basis.
      I took a break from creating music in order to focus more on my programming skills, but now I have gotten
      back into music production again.
      <br><br>
      I tend to produce semi-experimental electronic music spanning different genres.
      My DAW of choice is <a href="http://www.renoise.com/">Renoise</a>,
      an excellent tracker. In addition to this I use various plugins and samples.
      I have also had my way with Cubase and Ableton Live, though I now only use Renoise.
      <br><br>
      You will find my complete discography at <a href="http://hlilje.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>,
      while you can find some songs and more random clips at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hlilje">SoundCloud</a>.
