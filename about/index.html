          My name is Hampus Liljekvist (hlilje). I'm a 23 year old computer
          science and engineering student living in Stockholm, Sweden, and
          this is my official website.

          <br>
          I’m currently doing my fifth and hopefully final year at the Royal
          Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden, studying MSE
          Computer Science and Engineering (Master's in Theoretical Computer
          Science).
          <br>
          At the moment I’m fully focusing on these studies and my programming
          skills, but I also spend time producing music.
          Gaming and video games have always been my largest areas of interest.
          <br><br>
          This website works as a hub to my presence on the interwebs, since there
          are too many good sites today to justify hosting anything here.
          You'll find the links to your right.
          Also make sure to check out the other pages on this site for a more
          in-depth presentation of my current projects.
          <br><br>
          Good luck and have fun.
        </p>
