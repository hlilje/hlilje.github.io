      My name is Hampus Liljekvist (hlilje). I'm a 22 year old computer science student living in Stockholm, Sweden, and this is my official website.
      <br><br>
      I enjoy many things in life, like <a href="https://github.com/hlilje">software development</a>,
      good apps/web apps,

      <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/">e-sports</a>,
      learning,
      science,
      <a href="http://www.kth.se/en/csc">computer science</a>,
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/vaexelverkan">music</a>,
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hlilje">music production</a>,
      design,
      film,
      literature and
      what not.
      <br>
      I’m currently doing my fourth year at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, studying MSE Computer Science.
      <br>
      At the moment I’m fully focusing on these studies and my programming skills, but I also spend time producing music.
      Gaming and video games have always been my largest areas of interest.
      <br><br>
      This website works as a hub to my presence on the interwebs, since there are too many good sites today to justify hosting anything here.
      You'll find the links to your right.
      Also make sure to check out the other pages on this site for a more in-depth presentation of my current projects.
      <br><br>
      Good luck and have fun.
