  <h3><a href="#welcome" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>
  <p>
  My name is Hampus Liljekvist (a.k.a. hlilje), and this is my official website.
  <br><br>
  I enjoy many things in life, like computers, technology, programming, gaming and game development, StarCraft, e-sports, science and/or computer science, music, music production and what not.
  <br>
  I’m currently studying MSE Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
  <br>
  At the moment I’m focusing fully on studies and my skills as a programmer/game designer, but I have done some minor music production in the past.
  <br><br>
  This website will work as a sort of hub to my presence on the interwebs.
  As you may have noticed, this is the front page. Links are to your right.
  <br><br>
  Good luck and have fun.
