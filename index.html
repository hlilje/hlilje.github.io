    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Hampus Liljekvist, and this is my official website.
      <br><br>
      I enjoy many things in life, like computers, technology, programming, learning, gaming and game development, StarCraft, e-sports, science and/or computer science, music, music production and what not.
      <br>
      I’m currently studying MSE Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
      <br>
      At the moment I’m fully focusing on these studies and my programming skills, but I have done some minor music production in the past.
      <br><br>
      This website will work as a sort of hub to my presence on the interwebs.
      As you may have noticed, this is the front page. Links are to your right.
      <br><br>
      Good luck and have fun.
    </p>
