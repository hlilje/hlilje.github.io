My name is Hampus Liljekvist, and I love learning, problem solving and creation.
I'm currently working as an Experienced Programmer at Paradox Development Studio in Stockholm,
Sweden, and I'm an MSE Computer Science and Engineering alumnus at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology]({{ site.data.links['kth_homepage'] }})
with a Master's degree in (Theoretical) Computer Science.

I have three major passions in life, [software development]({{ site.data.links['github'][1] }}),
[music]({{ site.data.links['soundcloud'][1] }}) and [video games]({{ site.data.links['steam'][1] }}).
I fancy the combination of mathematical logic and creativity in hands-on programming,
particularly when it involves developing software for people to experience. Solving
complex problems in a tight-knit team and seeing the result manifest itself in a better
product is something I adore.

This website works as a hub to my online presence. You will find links to some of the
web services I use to your right or below, depending on the device you are viewing
this on.

Good luck and have fun.
