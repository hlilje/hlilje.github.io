Hi, I'm Hampus Liljekvist, game developer and amateur music producer interested in creating
compelling virtual experiences (read: video games). By trade an Experienced Programmer at [Paradox
Development Studio](https://paradoxplaza.com/) in Stockholm, Sweden, with a Master's degree
in Computer Science and Engineering from
[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]({{ site.data.links['kth_homepage'][1] }}).

### Work

I have worked as a programmer at Paradox since 2016, where the first five years were spent on the
grand strategy/4X video game [Stellaris](https://www.stellaris.com/en/pc) which included every expansion
up until (including) Apocalypse. I mainly did gameplay programming, but was in particular responsible for
multiplayer stability. I also contributed in other areas such as graphics and scripting.

Eventually I became tasked with starting up a secret project at PDS, which I worked on for a few months.

After that I spent close to a year working on the grand strategy game
[Imperator: Rome](https://www.gameimperator.com/), first with pre-launch and then with post-launch
support. I spent a significant amount of time on the multiplayer aspect of the game, while also
contributing with gameplay features and bespoke systems.

During my time on Imperator: Rome I also took part in a strike team for improving multiplayer
stability across all new PDS titles while adding new multiplayer features.

Today I work as an Experienced Programmer on the Tech (Engine) Team at PDS, where I'm developing
the tech that is shared by all our future and recently released titles. While I'm specialising in
graphics programming, I work with all kinds of systems depending on the needs of the game teams.
I also engage myself in other non-programming activities such as programmer mentoring, recruitment
and standardisation.

Before Paradox I've had various summer jobs while studying, for instance developing website features
for a major chain of building suppliers at [5 Monkeys](https://5monkeys.se/) in 2015, creating
an Excel tool for aiding with the analysis of the energy market at [Fortum](https://www.fortum.com/) in
2014, or revitalising an internal website for production substitution at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/)
in 2013.
