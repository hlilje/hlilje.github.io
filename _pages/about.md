Hi, I'm Hampus Liljekvist, game developer and amateur music producer interested in creating
compelling virtual experiences (read: video games). By trade a Game Programmer at [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com/)
in Stockholm, Sweden, with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from
[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]({{ site.data.links['kth_homepage'][1] }}).

### Work

I am since August 2021 working as a Game Programmer over at Embark Studios.

Previously I worked as a gameplay/engine programmer at Paradox Development Studio from 2016 to 2021, where the
first couple of years were spent on the grand strategy/4X video game [Stellaris](https://www.stellaris.com/en/pc)
which included every expansion up until (including) Apocalypse. I mainly did gameplay programming, but was in
particular responsible for multiplayer stability. I also contributed in other areas such as graphics, UI and
scripting.

Eventually I became tasked with starting up a secret project at PDS, which I worked on for a few months.

After that I spent close to a year working on the grand strategy game
[Imperator: Rome](https://www.gameimperator.com/), first with pre-launch and then with post-launch
support. I spent a significant amount of time on the multiplayer aspect of the game, while also
contributing with gameplay features and bespoke systems.

During my time on Imperator: Rome I also took part in a strike team for improving multiplayer
stability across all new PDS titles while adding new multiplayer features.

For my final ~2 years I worked as a programmer on the Tech (Engine) Team at PDS, where I was
developing the tech shared by all their future and recently released titles. While I was especially
focused on graphics programming and macOS, I worked with all kinds of systems depending on the needs
of the game teams. I also engaged myself in other non-programming activities such as programmer mentoring,
recruitment and standardisation.

Before Paradox I've had various summer jobs while studying, for instance developing website features
for a major chain of building suppliers at [5 Monkeys](https://5monkeys.se/) in 2015, creating
an Excel tool for aiding with the analysis of the energy market at [Fortum](https://www.fortum.com/) in
2014, or revitalising an internal website for product substitution at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/)
in 2013.
