## {{ page.title }}

I have since August 2016 worked as a programmer at [Paradox Development Studio](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/),
which has allowed me to combine my love for video games with my passion for software
development.

During my time at KTH I devoted my entire summer holidays to working, which in turn enabled
me to try out various types of tasks, teams and work methodologies.

### Experience

#### Paradox

The first 1.5 years at Paradox Development Studio (PDS) were spent working on the 4X grand strategy
video game [Stellaris](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/stellaris/STST01G-MASTER.html),
where my contributions can be seen from the expansion
Leviathans to the expansion Apocalypse (inclusive). My work mostly revolved around gameplay
programming, but I was in particular responsible for multiplayer stability. I also contributed in
other areas such as graphics and scripting.

Eventually I became tasked with starting up a secret project at PDS, which I worked on for a few months.

After that I spent close to a year working on the grand strategy game [Imperator: Rome](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/imperator-rome/IMIM01GSK0000001-MASTER.html),
first with pre-launch and then with post-launch support. I spent a significant amount of time
on the multiplayer aspect of the game, while also contributing with gameplay features and
bespoke systems.

During my time on Imperator: Rome I also took part in a strike team for improving multiplayer
stability across all new PDS titles while adding new multiplayer features.

Today I work as an Experienced Programmer on the Tech (Engine) Team at PDS, where I'm responsible
for the grand strategy software library shared by all unreleased and recently released titles from
the studio. While I'm specialising in graphics programming, I work with all kinds of systems depending
on the need of the game teams.

#### Past

The summer of 2015 was spent working as a web developer at [5 Monkeys](https://5monkeys.se/),
where I continued the development of a website for a major chain of building
suppliers. I worked with features, fixes and integration of a new product segment. The
work climate was relaxed but focused, and we valued dynamic development with close customer
collaboration. This [blog post](http://blog.{{ site.url_short }}/post/129018328988/some-takeaway-points-from-my-summer-job-at-5)
describes some takeaway points from my time at 5 Monkeys.

In the summer of 2014 I worked at [Fortum](https://www.fortum.com/) where I created an
Excel tool for downloading, interpreting, managing and uploading urgent energy market
information. I also created an Excel test suite for a database plugin. We used agile
methodologies with daily meetings and goals to make sure the work was going in the
right direction. See this [blog post](http://blog.{{ site.url_short }}/post/95636942628/fortum-summer-work-reflection)
for a reflection on my Fortum experience.

During the summer holiday of 2013 I worked at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/),
where I updated end enhanced an internal website for product substitution. I was the sole
developer on the project, which demanded apt ownership and feedback to secure its success.

### Master Thesis

I did my Master thesis at [Paradox Development Studio](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/),
where I looked at detection of synchronisation problems in networked lockstep games.
